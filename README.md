# Selfhost utilities

A collection of utilities for self hosters.
Every utility is in a folder with its relevant configuration and is completely separated from the other, so you can install only the ones you need.

## ðŸš¨ HEALTHCHECK

A simple server health check.
Allows to keep under control the machine vitals (cpu usage, raid status, thermals...) and alert the sysadmin in case of anomalies.

Sends an email and/or executes a command in case of alarm (high temperature, RAID disk failed etc...).
As an example, the command may be a ntfy call to obtain a notification on a mobile phone or desktop computer.
Meant to be run with a cron (see healthcheck.cron.example).
Tested on Debian 11, but should run on almost any standard linux box.

## ðŸ“Ÿ ESP32-LCD

A status LCD for your homelab! Low cost (about 20â‚¬ in parts), simple to build (no circuit board, no components, only an LCD, a ESP32 and, if needed, a potentiometer). Connects to your local wifi and receives HTTP requests from your homelab machines, and shows them to the screen.
