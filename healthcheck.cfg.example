#### HEALTH CHECKS ####
# Every health check is based on a command being executed, its result being parsed with a regexp
# to extract (as a single group) the numeric or string value, and the value being compared with
# a configured value. This checks are ready to be used, just enable the ones you need.
# You can add your own custom check declaring another section like this:
#
# [my_custom_check_name]
# DISABLED=False
# ALARM_STRING_EQUAL=Lorem ipsum
# ALARM_STRING_NOT_EQUAL=The lazy fox

# ALARM_VALUE_LESS_THAN=12
# COMMAND=/my/custom/binary --with parameters
# REGEXP=my regex to parse (awesome|disappointing) command output

[cpu_temperature]
# CPU Temperature alarm: requires lm-sensors installed and configured (check your distribution's guide)
